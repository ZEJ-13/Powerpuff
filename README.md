Gratitude Gram
This downloadable app allows the user to easily generate a Gratitude-Gram to send to friends through sms, email, or populate on their social media pages. It is a quick and easy way to remind the people we care about how much we appreciate them.

1. To begin, the user must download the app.
2. Once installed, they are invited to create a gram by choosing 3 terms from a bank of words such
as the following.

Words will need check boxes or color changes to indicate selected words.
Although words have group headings, users can choose 3 terms from any of the words; the headings are only to keep users from feeling overwhelmed when perusing the lists.
A notification will remind users that they are limited to 3 terms if they are attempting to choose more than 3 terms.
The word bank needs to be easily changed/updated with new terms.
3. The user is now invited to add either an emoji or frame from sets of AI generated graphics.
The app will provide a bank of emojis and corner sections of frames from which to choose.
The user can only choose one or the other.
The emojis and frames will be changed frequently so it must be easy to change them from the back end.
4. The gram is generated and become visible to the user.
5. The user is asked how they want the gram to be sent: sms, email, FB, Insta, X.
6. The user is asked to provide the username/handle for the recipient as well as their own username/handle.
7. If the user’s device is logged in, the gram is sent to the selected location. If it is not logged in, the user device will request login to send the gram.
Other notes:
Gram will have a small live link to another web site or app store for recipient to download the app if they are interested.
When finished gram is depicted, have a discreet box labeled “Copy Gratitude-Gram to clipboard” which, when clicked, will do so. Make sure the embedded link will still function.
